# Risc-V-micromips-processor
A complete basic 16 bit RISC processor made using verilog. 
Can perform all the 22 instructions provided in the microMIPS intruction set
2 extra modules also given to verify memory unit using file handling. The user need to store some values first in a word file which would be the values stored in the memory. This value will now read and written throughout the code to display values of different operations. This would ensure if the operation is working correcty or not.
